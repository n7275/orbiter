\section{Introduction}
This document is aimed at addon developers, or anyone who wants to extend Orbiter's functionality.\\
It details what is needed to create new vessels, both the simpler "configuration file" type, and the more capable "code module" type, as well as the 3D model for vessel visualisation during the simulation.
In this document you will also find information on how to modify, or adding, surface bases, moons, planets and entire planetary systems.\\
In addition, guidance is provided on how you can improve Orbiter's source code, by adding new features or fixing bugs.
